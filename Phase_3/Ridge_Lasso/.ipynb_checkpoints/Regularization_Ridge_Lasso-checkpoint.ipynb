    "Even though Lasso and Ridge regressions are only used in regression, regularizing a model is a common procedure in the process of building machine learning models. It is an effective procedure for tackling the problem of overfitting. Generally speaking, applying regularization technique introduces some **bias** to the model, but reduces the **variance**, and therefore results in better performance in testing data. As you will see later in this module, models built from various classification algorithms often require tuning using regularization in order to overcome overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "* *At zero coefficients, there is high bias but very little variance. As the coefficients increase the variance increases but bias reduces. complexity in the model is represented by the size of the coefficients*\n",
    "\n",
    "What is regularization in the context of regression? As we recall, as the complexity of model increases, the model overfits and performance on the testing set decreases. Regularization techniques *shrinks* the regression coefficients such that the coefficients are not affecting the outcomes as much as they originally would have. In other words, using regularization applies a *penalty* to the coefficients of your regression model. Let's see how exactly Ridge regression and Lasso regression work to reduce variances in regression models and result in better fit. "
